# Day 1: Report Repair
I started the first challenge very late after it was released. Fortunately for me, this day was not worth any points. :smile: So the actual challenge was more like a warm up for the upcoming ones and most of the time went into setting this whole project up.

Eagerly waiting for tomorrows challenge.

**Because of an outage during the day 1 puzzle unlock, day 1 is worth no points.**

## Part 1
#### Assignment
Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your **expense report** (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.

Specifically, they need you to **find the two entries that sum to `2020`** and then multiply those two numbers together.

For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:

    1721
    979
    366
    299
    675
    1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to `2020` are `1721` and `299`. Multiplying them together produces `1721 * 299 = 514579`, so the correct answer is **`514579`**.

Of course, your expense report is much larger. **Find the two entries that sum to `2020`; what do you get if you multiply them together?**

Your puzzle answer was `381699`.

## Part 2
#### Assignment
The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find **three** numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to `2020` are `979`, `366`, and `675`. Multiplying them together produces the answer, **`241861950`**.

In your expense report, **what is the product of the three entries that sum to `2020`?**

Your puzzle answer was `111605670`.
